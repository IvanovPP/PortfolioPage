To effectively monitor and manage issues, we used an IT Ticket Management system, specifically ServiceNow. In the area of user account management, our duties included creating various accounts, providing access to the necessary applications, and installing the required software based on the departmental needs. We were also in charge of resolving software and network problems, communicating with different IT teams, removing user accounts after the users left the company, and all the subsequent steps to revoke access. As for technical support, we were responsible for creating a knowledge database for the team and new employees, solving problems that required more advanced technical skills for level 2 support, and providing direct assistance to managers in troubleshooting. We also organized meetings with the leaders of the organizations to address specific local issues, and coordinated regular meetings with various local teams and managers.
